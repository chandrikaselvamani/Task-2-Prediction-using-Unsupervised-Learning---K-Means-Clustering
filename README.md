# Task-2-Prediction-using-Unsupervised-Learning-K-Means-Clustering
Dataset: The dataset consists of 5 columns. In which the columns Sepal length,Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width are the independent variables which explains the nature of petals and sepals of the Iris flowers. The column species represent the dependent variable which tells about the different species types of Iris flowers.


Method:The method used here is the unsupervised model, K-Means clustering. Basically clustering means dividing the entire data into different groups based on certain patterns present among the data. In the case of k-means distance is calculated and assigned as a point to the cluster. K-Means is a centroid based algorithm/ distance based algorithm. The main purpose of K-Means is to reduce the distance between the points and the centroid assigned to a specific cluster.
